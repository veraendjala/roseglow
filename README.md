# roseglow
Rose Glow was founded on the 19th of September 2019 by Rhona Haifene. The main goal of this business is to ensure that all our clients end up glowing and looking beautiful. 
Rose Glow provides clients make-up sessions, one-on-one lessons on how to apply make-up as well as make-up kits.
In 2020, Rose Glow partnered up with Abre creations on their Spring swimwear collection. 
The pictures from the photoshoot are up and running on our website while the swimwear items can be purchased from their Instagram page.
